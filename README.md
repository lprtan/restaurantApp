# Yelp Restaurant Finder App

This React Native app allows users to search for restaurants using the Yelp API based on price (cheap, moderate, or expensive) and food type (e.g., burgers, sushi). Users can view a list of matching restaurants, and tap on any to see detailed information, such as photos, phone number, and whether the restaurant is currently open.
